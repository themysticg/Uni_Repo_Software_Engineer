## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that combines data (attributes) and methods that work with that data into a single unit known as a class. This protective layer around the data maintains its integrity and prevents unauthorized access.

Consider a car. The car body houses the engine, transmission, and brakes. You can interact with the car using its controls (steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal), but you don’t need to understand how they function. This is similar to the way encapsulation works in programming. 

## Abstraction

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

That’s a very generic concept that’s not limited to object-oriented programming. You can find it everywhere in the real world.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

You can use it to declare different kinds of exceptions, add custom logic to existing frameworks, and even map your domain model to a database.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, polymorphism describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface.

You can perform a simple test to know whether an object is polymorphic. If the object successfully passes multiple is-a or instanceof tests, it’s polymorphic. As described in our post about inheritance, all Java classes extend the class Object. Due to this, all objects in Java are polymorphic because they pass at least two instanceof checks.
